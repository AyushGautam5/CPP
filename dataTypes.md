# Data Types

Data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. 
They are an important concept in programming and are used to ensure that the data is stored and used correctly.

## Basic Data Types

C++ provides several basic data types that are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. Some of the basic data types in C++ include:

1. **Primitive Data Types** : These are the basic data types that are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold.
2. **Derived Data Types** : These are the data types that are derived from other data types.
3. **User-Defined Data Types** : These are the data types that are defined by the user.
