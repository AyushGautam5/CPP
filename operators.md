Operators are symbols that are used for mathematical and logical computation on operands.

They are of three types(based on number of operands):

1. Unary: Requires a single operand. E.g, X++, ++X, etc.
2. Binary: Require two operands. E.g, a+b, a*b, etc.
3. Ternary: Require three operands. E.g, a ? b: c

## Types of Operators (Based on their FUNCTIONALITY)

### Arithmatic Operators

They are operators which are used to perform arithmetic or mathematical operations.

Example: +, -, *, /, %, etc.

The division operator of C++ performs so-called integer division. This means the answer is rounded to an integer (towards 0).
Hence 7 / 3 = 2, with the remainder 1, and -7 / 3 = -2.

### Assignment Operators

They are used to assign values to variables.
Example, = ,+= ,-= , *= , /= ,etc.

Remember itâ€™s denoted by =. That is different from the equality operator ==.

### Relational Operators

They are used to compare values and determine if they are equal or not.
The value is either 0 or 1 (true or false).

### Logical Operators

They are used to perform logical operations on variables and value.
**Note** : 0 denotes false and everything other than 0 denotes true.

AND (&&)
OR (||)
NOT (!)

### Increment and Decrement Operators

These are operators that are used to increment or decrement the value of a variable.

++ denotes increment by 1
-- denotes decrement by 1

If we apply the operator before the variable, like ++a or --b, then first the value of the variable is changed by 1 and then the expression is evaluated.

If we apply the operator after the variable, like a++ or b--, then first the expression is evaluated and then the value of the variable is changed by 1.

### Bitwise operators

They are used to perform bitwise operations on variables and values. Bitwise operations are used to manipulate individual bits of a binary number. Decimal numbers are represented using binary numbers, which are made up of 1s and 0s. Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on these binary numbers.
