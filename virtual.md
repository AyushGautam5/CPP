# üìò Virtual Functions in C++ 

## What is a Virtual Function?
A **virtual function** in C++ is a member function in the **base class** that is marked with the keyword `virtual` and can be **overridden** in derived classes.

It enables **runtime polymorphism**, meaning:
> The function that gets called is determined **at runtime**, based on the actual object type (not pointer type).

---

### ‚ùì Why use a base class pointer to refer to a derived class object?

‚úÖ To achieve **runtime polymorphism**  
‚úÖ To allow **one interface, many implementations**  
‚úÖ To write **flexible and reusable code**  
‚úÖ To handle **different objects uniformly**  
‚úÖ To use **abstract classes** as interfaces

üìå Example:

```cpp
Animal* a;
Dog d;
a = &d;
a->speak();  // Calls Dog::speak() due to dynamic dispatch
```

## Why Use Virtual Functions?

Without `virtual`:
```cpp
Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak();  // Calls Animal::speak() ‚ùå
```
With `virtual`:
```cpp
Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak();  // Calls Dog::speak() ‚úÖ
```

## Key Concepts                 

| Term             | Meaning                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `virtual`        | Keyword used to mark a function for dynamic (runtime) dispatch            |
| vtable           | A table storing pointers to virtual functions                             |
| vptr             | A hidden pointer inside each object that points to its class's vtable     |
| dynamic dispatch | Function call is resolved at runtime based on actual object               |
| static dispatch  | Function call is resolved at compile time based on pointer/reference type |


## Behavior Without Virtual Function

Function calls are bound at compile-time. 
This is called static binding or early binding ‚Äî it happens at compile time.
Based on type of pointer, not object.
‚ùå Does not support polymorphism.
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void speak() { cout << "Animal\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() { cout << "Dog\n"; }
};

Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak();  // ‚ùå Output: Animal
```
Without virtual, the compiler uses static binding. Since a is an Animal*, the function call is resolved at compile time, and it always calls Animal::speak(), even if a points to a Dog object.

## Behavior With Virtual Function

Function calls are bound at runtime.
Based on actual object type, even when using base class pointers.
‚úÖ Enables polymorphism.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() { cout << "Animal\n"; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override { cout << "Dog\n"; }
};

Animal* a = new Dog();
a->speak();  // ‚úÖ Output: Dog
```
### Step-by-Step Internal Process with virtual:

1. vtable is created (at compile time): 
   -> Each class with virtual functions gets a vtable (a hidden static table of function pointers).

   eg: Animal's vtable ‚Üí [ &Animal::speak ]
       Dog's vtable    ‚Üí [ &Dog::speak ]

2. vptr is inserted in object (at runtime):
   -> A hidden pointer called vptr is added inside d
   -> vptr points to Dog's vtable
    Ex: Dog d:
        +---------------------+
        | vptr ‚Üí Dog's vtable |
        +---------------------+

3. When you call: a->speak()
   C++ says:
    "Hmm, speak() is virtual, so don‚Äôt call based on a‚Äôs type"

    Instead:
    Follow a ‚Üí points to d
    Follow d's vptr ‚Üí Dog‚Äôs vtable
    Call Dog::speak() ‚úÖ

With virtual, C++ uses dynamic binding through a hidden mechanism called vtable.
Each object of a class with virtual functions has a hidden pointer called vptr that points to the class‚Äôs vtable, which stores function addresses.
So at runtime, the function call (a->speak()) is dispatched using the actual object‚Äôs vtable, not the pointer type.
That‚Äôs why Dog::speak() is called when a points to a Dog.



## Is virtual Needed in Derived Class?
No.
Once a function is declared virtual in the base class, it remains virtual in all derived classes, even if not re-marked.
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak();  // virtual
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak();          // still virtual (inherited)
};
```

## What Happens Internally (Memory Layout)?

Compiler creates a vtable for each class that has virtual functions (inherited or declared).
Each object of such class has a hidden vptr that points to the correct vtable.
Function call like a->speak() is resolved by:
Using the vptr ‚Üí to vtable ‚Üí to the correct function.

Animal* a = new Dog();

a
|
v
[Dog object]
  |
  +-- vptr ----> [Dog's vtable]
                  |
                  +-- speak() --> Dog::speak()

##  Benefits of Virtual Functions

‚úÖ Enables runtime polymorphism
‚úÖ Makes code more flexible and maintainable
‚úÖ Supports abstraction and interfaces via abstract classes

##  Pure Virtual Function in C++

- A virtual function with **no implementation** in the base class.
- Declared using `= 0` syntax.
- Makes the class **abstract**.
- Must be **overridden** in derived class.

```cpp
class Base {
    virtual void show() = 0;  // Pure virtual
};
```

### Purpose:

It tells the compiler:
"Every class that derives from me must override this function."

### Can a Pure Virtual Function Have a Body?

Yes! Though rare, a pure virtual function can have a body outside the class.
```cpp
class A {
public:
    virtual void func() = 0;  // Still pure virtual
};

void A::func() {
    cout << "Definition of pure virtual function\n";
}
```
This is allowed but usually used only when you want the derived class to override it, but still call the base version using Base::func().

## Are There Any Other Types of Virtual Functions?
Yes! 

| Type                            | Syntax                                      | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual Function**            | `virtual void show();`                      | Enables polymorphism; optional to override                    |
| **Pure Virtual Function**       | `virtual void show() = 0;`                  | Forces derived classes to override; makes base class abstract |
| **Virtual Destructor**          | `virtual ~ClassName();`                     | Ensures derived class destructor is called via base pointer   |
| **Overridden Virtual Function** | In derived class with or without `override` | Implements or customizes base class virtual function          |

# NOTE 
### Is it necessary to override every virtual function of the base class?
Answer:
‚úÖ Only pure virtual functions must be overridden in the derived class to make it concrete (instantiable).
‚ùå Regular virtual functions do not have to be overridden ‚Äî the base class version will be used by default.

### ‚úÖ How to override virtual / pure virtual functions in derived class

1. Use same function signature as base class
2. Use `override` keyword for safety (recommended)
3. For pure virtual (`= 0`), overriding is **mandatory**

üìå Example:

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() = 0;     // Pure virtual
    virtual void eat() {          // Regular virtual
        cout << "Animal eats\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        cout << "Dog barks\n";
    }

    void eat() override {
        cout << "Dog eats bone\n";
    }
};
```

## What is a Virtual Destructor in C++?

‚úÖ A virtual destructor ensures that both the **base and derived class destructors** are properly called  
when an object is deleted through a **base class pointer**.

üîÅ Without `virtual`, only the base destructor is called ‚Üí can cause **memory leaks**.
üìå Example:
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual ~Animal() {
        cout << "Animal destroyed\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    ~Dog() {
        cout << "Dog destroyed\n";
    }
};

Animal* a = new Dog();
delete a;  // ‚úÖ Both destructors called correctly
```
